1. Passive T-Maze (pure long memory) shows "Transformer-based agent can solve long-term memory low-dimensional tasks with
good sample efficiency."
2. Passive Visual Match shows: "Transformer-based agent is more sample-efficient in long-term memory highdimensional tasks."
3. `Key to Door` and `Active T-Maze` (credit assignment) shows: "Transformer-based RL improves temporal credit assignment compared to LSTMbased RL, but its advantage diminishes in long-term scenarios"
